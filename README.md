# ObjectTracking-Project-in-Python
This project implements a program to track an object in a video using the Discriminative Correlation Filter with Channel and Spatial Reliability (CSR-DCF) algorithm in the Python programming language, with the help of the OpenCV library. The importance of this topic is highlighted by its applicability in various fields, including video surveillance, autonomous vehicles, and traffic monitoring. The approach of this project involves the use of the OpenCV library in Python, which provides powerful tools for image processing and object tracking. The project aims to provide an efficient and real-time solution for monitoring and identifying moving objects in a video stream. The implementation of the CSRT algorithm offers a robust solution for object tracking, and the results are highlighted through a video output where the object is successfully tracked.
